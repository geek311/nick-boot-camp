Hi there.

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:03,410
My name's Nick Todd.

3
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:12,130
You're gonna be using this video to do a short exercise where you are going to take the content of this video translated into another language and dubbing with subtitles.

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:16,450
Those subtitles will be in English, but they also then be done in a foreign language.

5
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:21,250
Then you can even replace my voice with an artificial voice speaking out

6
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:28,720
in the foreign language, and you'll see how all of this could be done using the various Amazon machine learning and artificial intelligence services.

7
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:29,650
So good luck

8
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,480
and enjoy the exercise.
