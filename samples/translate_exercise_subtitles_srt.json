Hi there. 

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:03,410
My name's Nick Todd. 

3
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:06,320
You're gonna be using this video to do a short exercise 

4
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:08,640
where you are going to take the content of this video 

5
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:12,130
translated into another language and dubbing with subtitles. 

6
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:14,200
Those subtitles will be in English, 

7
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:16,450
but they also then be done in a foreign language. 

8
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:22,600
Then you can even replace my voice with an artificial voice speaking out in the foreign language, 

9
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:28,720
and you'll see how all of this could be done using the various Amazon machine learning and artificial intelligence services.

00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:31,480
So good luck and enjoy the exercise.
